## ⚠️ API Timeout Issues

### Hootsuite Competitive Playbook
- **Status:** Failed due to Anthropic API socket timeout
- **Attempts:** 2 attempts, both timed out after 5+ minutes
- **Error:** `FetchError: Invalid response body while trying to fetch https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages: Socket timeout`

**Root Cause:**
The Anthropic API experienced performance issues during generation, causing long-running API calls to timeout before completion. This is an infrastructure issue on Anthropic's side, not a code problem.

**Retry Command:**
```bash
cd /Users/jp/vistasocial
npm run dev playbook hootsuite.com -- -t competitive -f "Defending market position against Sprout Social in mid-market and enterprise"
```
